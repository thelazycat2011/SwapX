# SwapX
The playtime swapping utility  

## Usage guide
1. Choose a level you want as the swap
2. Save the level as .gmd (GDShare is neccesary here) to the leveldb folder in the game's folder (if you didnt see it, make one. Usually the mod will already generate it the first time you open the menu)
3. Open the menu (default keybind is Ctrl + L)
4. Choose the level and then decide if you want it to only swap on specific level
5. Swap! (default keybind is N)
6. Enjoy! and dont get banned because of this
